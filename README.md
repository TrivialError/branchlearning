# branchlearning
Learning branch variables in a graph based discrete optimization branch and bound algorithm

The file branchandbound.py implements the branch and bound algorithm, and uses functions from TSPfunctions.py. The branch and bound algorithm is run from main.py

The file graph_embedding_nn.py contains the model and functions for learning the graph embedding.

The file neural_networks.py contains functions for evaluating the learned model.

Other files are mostly ancillary.
